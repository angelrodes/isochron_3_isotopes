Cosmogenic isotopes are used to date the time that a surface or sediment has been exposed or buried. However, when the exposure history of the landform involves more than a single exposure-burial cycle, single or paired cosmogenic isotope analysis provide only minimum or maximum ages. We have developed a 3-isotope method to calculate the deposition age of sediments with a complex exposure history involving several exposure-burial cycles.

This method was firstly presented in
